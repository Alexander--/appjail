soon:

* option to disable coredumps
* make defaults for --keep and --keep-full configurable
* add an option to mask directories
* optionally allow access to the dbus system bus (this may make steam work
  with -R user instead of -R host)

maybe:

* add optional size limits for the tmpfs instances (SWAPDIR, /dev/shm)
* allow binding more file systems under /home
* (maybe) allow binding a custom {/var,}/tmp
* handle dbus sockets?
* add optional seccomp restrictions?
* bind/copy some configuration files from the host?
