urgent:

* handle /run: keep, only keep /run/user/$UID, create private /run
* more thorough checks to ensure no unprivileged user has the possibility to manipulate appjail.conf

soon:

* option to disable coredumps
* make defaults for --keep and --keep-full configurable
* add an option to mask directories
* make missing cap_chown non-fatal, but add a warning
* make more defaults configurable, i.e. network

maybe:

* add optional size limits for the tmpfs instances (SWAPDIR, /dev/shm)
* allow binding more file systems under /home
* (maybe) allow binding a custom {/var,}/tmp
* handle dbus sockets?
* add optional seccomp restrictions?
* bind/copy some configuration files from the host?
